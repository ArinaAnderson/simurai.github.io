![DuoTone themes](/img/posts/duotone-dark.png)

Double-hue syntax themes for __Atom__.

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (7 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

A __big thanks__ goes to [@braver](https://github.com/braver) who did most of the initial [language support](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-dark-syntax/pull/2).
