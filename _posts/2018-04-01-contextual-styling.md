Something I've been wanting for a long time, define different regions like a footer section, or side bar and not have to deal with all the contextual styling hassle. A.k.a. ‚ÄúNow that this button is used on a dark background, the button needs to change its colors too. Where should the styles live?‚Äù. Here an old post about [struggling with contextual styling](http://simurai.com/blog/2015/05/11/nesting-components).

So then the other day I was doing [some experiments](https://github.com/atom/design-decisions/pull/4#issuecomment-356835247) with using custom properties for Atom's UI. Turns out, using custom properties might make contextual styling a bit easier. For the rest of the post, let's switch to a more simple example. A page where the main area is light, but then has a dark hero and footer section. Like this:

<img height="300px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/38169286-2fd31f54-35a1-11e8-8ae4-9e1fe892baf5.png" />

In the past, I probably would‚Äôve created variations like `Button--dark` or overwrote it with `header .Button {‚Ä¶}`. Depends a bit on the project. Here another approach: Create themes with a set of variables, then apply the theme to the different areas.

## 1. Default theme

First let‚Äôs define our default theme with a bunch of variables.

```css
[data-theme="default"] {
  --fg:         hsl(0,0%,25%);
  --border:     hsl(0,0%,75%);
  
  --bg:         hsl(0,0%,95%);
  --button-bg:  hsl(0,0%,99%);
  --input-bg:   hsl(0,0%,90%);
}
```

Then we create some components where we use the variables defined above.

```css
[data-theme] {
  color: var(--fg);
  background-color: var(--bg);
}

.Button {
  color: var(--fg);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  background-color: var(--button-bg);
}

.Input {
  color: var(--fg);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  background-color: var(--input-bg);
}
```

And lastly we add the `[data-theme="default"]` attribute on the body so that our components will pick up the variables.

```html
<body data-theme="default">
```

If you wonder why use `data-theme` attributes over classes? Well, no specific reason. Maybe with attributes, it‚Äôs a hint that only one theme should be used per element and is more separated from your other classes.

At this point we get this:

<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="3586" data-slug-hash="be9c343986c1853c0487011d686678b7" data-default-tab="result" data-user="simurai" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Contextual styling with custom properties (1/3)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/simurai/pen/be9c343986c1853c0487011d686678b7/">Contextual styling with custom properties (1/3)</a> by simurai (<a href="https://codepen.io/simurai">@simurai</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## 2. Dark theme

But our designer wants the hero and footer to be dark. Alright, let‚Äôs define another theme region.

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --fg:         hsl(0,10%,70%);
  --border:     hsl(0,10%,10%);
  
  --bg:         hsl(0,0%,20%);
  --button-bg:  hsl(0,0%,25%);
  --input-bg:   hsl(0,0%,15%);
}
```

And add the theme attribute to the header and footer.

```html
<header data-theme="dark">
<footer data-theme="dark">
```

Which gives us this:

<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="3586" data-slug-hash="b7a9532fe4607536b4c8acb659fbcabe" data-default-tab="result" data-user="simurai" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Contextual styling with custom properties (2/3)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/simurai/pen/b7a9532fe4607536b4c8acb659fbcabe/">Contextual styling with custom properties (2/3)</a> by simurai (<a href="https://codepen.io/simurai">@simurai</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The reason why this works is that custom properties cascade and can be overridden on nested elements, just like normal properties.

## 3. Hero theme

A few months pass and our designer comes back with a redesigned hero section. ‚ÄúTo make it look fresh‚Äù with a splash of color.

No problem! Just like with the dark theme, we define a new ‚Äúhero‚Äù theme.

```css
[data-theme="hero"] {
  --fg:         hsl(240,50%,90%);
  --border:     hsl(240,50%,10%);
  
  --bg:         hsl(240,33%,30%);
  --button-bg:  hsl(240,33%,40%);
  --input-bg:   hsl(240,33%,20%);
}
```

```html
<header data-theme="hero">
```

And here is that fresh hero:

<p data-height="340" data-theme-id="3586" data-slug-hash="c995ced84077d0823a1496ee6fbacd27" data-default-tab="result" data-user="simurai" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Contextual styling with custom properties (3/3)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/simurai/pen/c995ced84077d0823a1496ee6fbacd27/">Contextual styling with custom properties (3/3)</a> by simurai (<a href="https://codepen.io/simurai">@simurai</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

It‚Äôs also not limited to colors only, could be used for sizes, fonts or anything that makes sense to define as variables. 

## Benefits

Using these theme ‚Äúregions‚Äù lets your components stay context **un-aware** and you can use them in multiple themes. Even on the same page.

- Developers can add components, move components around, without having to know about in what context (theme) they live. The **markup** for the components **stays the same**.
- Design systems authors can create new components without worrying about where they get used, the **variables** used in components **stay the same**.
- Designers can define new theme regions, or change existing ones, without having to make changes to a component‚Äôs **HTML or CSS**, it **stays the same**.

Less time to talk about who, how and where, more time to talk about the weather. ‚òîÔ∏èüôÉ

## Concerns

Yeah, right. The big question: But does it scale? Can this be used for all use cases.

Ok, I‚Äôm pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt fit all situations. There are just too many to find a single solution for them all. And I‚Äôm actually not sure how well it scales. I guess it works great in these simple demos, but I have yet to find a larger project to test it on. So if you have used (or plan to use) this approach, I‚Äôm curious to know how it went.

A concern I can imagine is that the list of variables might grow quickly if themes have totally different characteristics. Like not just a bit darker or lighter backgrounds. Then you might need to have foreground and border colors for each component (or group of components) and can‚Äôt just use the general `--fg` and `--border` variables. Naming these variables is probably the hardest part.

-----

P.S. On a side note, I‚Äôm also excited about CSS colors level 4. The [color-mod()](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#modifying-colors) function lets you do stuff like darken/lighten with custom properties.

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --button-bg: color-mod(var(--bg) lightness(10%));
}
```

This will make it possible to change themes **at runtime** with fewer hard-coded values. Just change `--bg` and the rest adapts accordingly. üòç

## Update

[@giuseppegurgone](https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone) made an interesting [comment](
https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/980398653453021184):

> in suitcss projects I used to define component level custom props, theme variables and then create themes by mapping the former to the latter https://github.com/giuseppeg/suitcss-toolkit/tree/example-app/examples/app#themes

So if I understood it correctly, by mapping theme variables to component variables, you could avoid your theme variables from growing too much and you can decide for each component how to use these theme variables.
